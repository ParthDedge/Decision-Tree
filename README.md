# Decision-Tree
# üå≥ Decision Tree Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for a binary classification problem. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

## üìå Project Overview

The objective of this project was to build and evaluate a Decision Tree model that accurately classifies input data into two classes. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and split into training and testing sets. The model achieved strong performance metrics, making it a reliable and interpretable solution for classification tasks.

## üîç Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using standard classification metrics:

| Metric        | Class 0 | Class 1 |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Precision     | 96%     | 93%     |
| Recall        | 96%     | 93%     |
| F1-Score      | 96%     | 93%     |
| Support       | 71      | 43      |

- **Overall Accuracy**: 95%  
- **Macro Avg F1-Score**: 94%  
- **Weighted Avg F1-Score**: 95%

These results indicate that the classifier performs consistently across both classes with no major imbalance or overfitting.
